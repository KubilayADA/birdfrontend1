          Birds aren't just pretty feathers and melodies; they're essential for
          keeping our world in balance. They help with things like spreading
          seeds, eating pests, and pollinating plants. However, the loss of
          biodiversity is putting many bird species at risk. In Europe alone,
          over 20% of bird species are on the decline, and several hundred
          species are listed on Europe's Red List due to threats like habitat
          loss and climate change.
